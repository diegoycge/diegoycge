Hi, I’m @diegoycge - political science student at Duke interested in using data analysis, visualization and statistical methods to supplement theoretical and critical understand contemporary political problems of our times. 

I am currently working on a project that tries to find patterns within published UK Visa statistics, paying particular attention to nationality, influence of major events, time of application, etc.

Get in touch with me at diego.ge@proton.me or Signal at @diego.81 !
